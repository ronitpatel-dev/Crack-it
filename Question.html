                    It helps you stay confident, structure your answers clearly, and avoid
                    being caught off guard. A well-prepared candidate stands out and has a
                    better chance of getting selected.<br><br>

                    <b>How to Crack These Questions Smartly:</b><br><br>
                    Research the company and role – Know what they expect.<br><br>
                    Practice common questions – Especially technical and HR-related.<br><br>
                    Use the STAR method for behavioral answers – Situation, Task, Action,
                    Result.<br><br>
                    Be honest but strategic – Show learning even from failures.<br><br>
                    Stay calm and confident – Good communication often matters more than a
                    perfect answer.<br><br>
                    Mock interviews help – Practice with friends or mentors to improve.<br><br>
